# Definitions A

## Address Resolution Protocol
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite.
ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826, which is Internet Standard STD 37.

## Address Resolution Protocol Spoofing
In computer networking, ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network.

## Advanced Encryption Standard
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛindaːl]),[5] is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.

## Advanced Persistent Threat
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.
In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state-sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.

## Adware
Adware, often called advertising-supported software by its developers, is software that generates revenue for its developer by automatically generating online advertisements in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process.

## Anonymous Surfing
Anonymous surfing allows you to wander the Internet without leaving any track of your computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address.
This is accomplished via a proxy service.

## Antivirus
Antivirus software (abbreviated to AV software), also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware.

## Application Blacklisting
In computing, a blacklist, disallowlist, blocklist, or denylist is a basic access control mechanism that allows through all elements (email addresses, users, passwords, URLs, IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, etc.), except those explicitly mentioned.

## Application Programming Interface
An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.
It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.
A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification.

## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans.
AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.

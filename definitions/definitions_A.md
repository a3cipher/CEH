## Address Resolution Protocol
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite.
ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826, which is Internet Standard STD 37.

## Address Resolution Protocol Spoofing
In computer networking, ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network.

## Advanced Persistent Threat
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.
In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state-sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.

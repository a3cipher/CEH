# Defintions N

## NetBIOS
NetBIOS (/ˈnɛtbaɪɒs/) is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System.
It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network.
As strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol.

`Nbtstat`
Nbstat is a utility that displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections using NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), which helps troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution issues.

`PsExec` can be used to interact with NetBIOS.

## Network File System
Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984,[1] allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system.

## Network Time Protocol
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.

## nmap
Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon.
Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

## Race Condition
A race condition or race hazard is the condition of an electronics, software, or other system where the system's substantive behavior is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events.
It becomes a bug when one or more of the possible behaviors is undesirable.

## Rainbow Table
A rainbow table is an efficient way to store data that has been computed in advance to facilitate cracking passwords.
To protect stored passwords from compromise in case of a data breach, organizations avoid storing them directly, instead transforming them using a scrambling function – typically a cryptographic hash.

## Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or permanently block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

## Rate Limiting
In computer networks, rate limiting is used to control the rate of requests sent or received by a network interface controller.
It can be used to prevent DoS attacks and limit web scraping.

## Recon-ng
Recon-ng is a Web Reconnaissance tool written in Python.
It has so many modules, database interaction, built-in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted, and we can gather all information.

## Remote Access Trojan
A RAT (remote access Trojan) is malware an attacker uses to gain full administrative privileges and remote control of a target computer.

## Remote Procedure Call
Microsoft RPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call) is a modified version of DCE/RPC. Additions include partial support for UCS-2 (but not Unicode) strings, implicit handles, and complex calculations in the variable-length string and structure paradigms already present in DCE/RPC.

## Replay Attack
A replay attack (also known as a repeat attack or playback attack) is a form of network attack in which valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.

## Remote File Inclusion
Remote file inclusion (RFI) occurs when the web application downloads and executes a remote file. These remote files are usually obtained in the form of an HTTP or FTP URI as a user-supplied parameter to the web application.

## Representational State Transfer
Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, often across the Internet in a client-server architecture.

## Return Oriented Programming
Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a computer security exploit technique that allows an attacker to execute code in the presence of security defenses such as executable space protection and code signing.

## Reverse Engineering
Reverse engineering (also known as backwards engineering or back engineering) is a process or method through which one attempts to understand through deductive reasoning how a previously made device, process, system, or piece of software accomplishes a task with very little (if any) insight into exactly how it does so.

## Risk Management
Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks (defined in ISO 31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives) followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.

### Risk management - identification

After establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.
Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits.
Hence, risk identification can start with the source of problems and those of competitors (benefit), or with the problem's consequences.

### Risk management - assessment
Once risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence.
These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown.

### Risk management - treatment
Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:
- Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
- Reduction (optimize – mitigate)
- Sharing (transfer – outsource or insure)
- Retention (accept and budget)

## Risk Matrix
A risk matrix is a matrix that is used during risk assessment to define the level of risk by considering the category of probability or likelihood against the category of consequence severity.

## Role Based Access Control
In computer systems security, role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.
It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

## Rootkit
A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.

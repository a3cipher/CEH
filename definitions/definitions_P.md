## Packet Fragmentation
IP fragmentation is an Internet Protocol (IP) process that breaks packets into smaller pieces (fragments), so that the resulting pieces can pass through a link with a smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) than the original packet size.
The fragments are reassembled by the receiving host.

## Pass the Hash
In computer security, pass the hash is a hacking technique that allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying NTLM or LanMan hash of a user's password, instead of requiring the associated plaintext password as is normally the case.
It replaces the need for stealing the plaintext password to gain access with stealing the hash.

## Password Cracking
In cryptanalysis and computer security, password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system in scrambled form.
A common approach (brute-force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password.

## Password Spraying Attack
Password spraying is a type of brute force attack.
In this attack, an attacker will brute force logins based on list of usernames with default passwords on the application.

## Phishing
Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware.

## Piggybacking
In security, piggybacking, similar to tailgating, refers to when a person tags along with another person who is authorized to gain entry into a restricted area, or pass a certain checkpoint.

## Post Office Protocol
In computing, the Post Office Protocol (POP) is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server.
POP version 3 (POP3) is the version in common use, and along with IMAP the most common protocols for email retrieval.

## Potentially Unwanted Application
A potentially unwanted program (PUP) or potentially unwanted application (PUA) is software that a user may perceive as unwanted or unnecessary.
It is used as a subjective tagging criterion by security and parental control products.

## Pretexting
Pretexting is a type of social engineering attack that involves a situation, or pretext, created by an attacker in order to lure a victim into a vulnerable situation and to trick them into giving private information, specifically information that the victim would typically not give outside the context of the pretext.

## Protocol Analyzer
A protocol analyzer is a tool (hardware or software) used to capture and analyze signals and data traffic over a communication channel.
Such a channel varies from a local computer bus to a satellite link, that provides a means of communication using a standard communication protocol (networked or point-to-point).

## Proxy Server
In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

### Proxy chaining
Proxy chaining involves forwarding traffic from one proxy server to another.

## Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.

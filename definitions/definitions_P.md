## Packet Fragmentation
IP fragmentation is an Internet Protocol (IP) process that breaks packets into smaller pieces (fragments), so that the resulting pieces can pass through a link with a smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) than the original packet size.
The fragments are reassembled by the receiving host.

## Password Cracking
In cryptanalysis and computer security, password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system in scrambled form.
A common approach (brute-force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password.

## Password Spraying Attack
Password spraying is a type of brute force attack.
In this attack, an attacker will brute force logins based on list of usernames with default passwords on the application.

## Post Office Protocol

## Potentially Unwanted Application
A potentially unwanted program (PUP) or potentially unwanted application (PUA) is software that a user may perceive as unwanted or unnecessary.
It is used as a subjective tagging criterion by security and parental control products.

## Proxy Server
In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

### Proxy chaining
Proxy chaining involves forwarding traffic from one proxy server to another.

## Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.

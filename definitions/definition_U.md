## Uniform Resource Locator
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.
A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably.

## CIA Triad
Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.

### Confidentiality
Involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.

### Integrity
Means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.

### Availability
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.

## Clickjacking
Clickjacking (classified as a user interface redress attack or UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, thus potentially revealing confidential information or allowing others to take control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous objects, including web pages.

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.

### Public cloud 
Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.

### Private cloud
Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.

### Hybrid cloud
Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources,[100][101] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.

### Community cloud
Community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and either hosted internally or externally.

### Infrastructure as a service
"Infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc.

### Platform as a service
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.

### Software as a service
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure.

## Code Review
Code review (sometimes referred to as peer review) is a software quality assurance activity in which one or several people check a program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code, and they do so after implementation or as an interruption of implementation.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.

## Command and Control
This term is also in common use within the computer security industry and in the context of cyberwarfare.
Here the term refers to the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control.

## Command Injection
Command injection is a cyber attack that involves executing arbitrary commands on a host operating system (OS).
Typically, the threat actor injects the commands by exploiting an application vulnerability, such as insufficient input validation.

## Competitive Intelligence
Competitive intelligence (CI) is the process and forward-looking practices used in producing knowledge about the competitive environment to improve organizational performance.

## Concatenation
In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end.
For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball".
In certain formalisations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion.

## Containerization
Containerization is operating system-level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor.

## Content Addressable Memory Table
Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table is a system memory construct used by Ethernet switch logic which stores information such as MAC addresses available on physical ports with their associated VLAN Parameters.

## Content Management System
A content management system (CMS) is computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content (content management).
A CMS is typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM).

## Cookie
HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser.

## Credential Stuffing
Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack in which the attacker collects stolen account credentials, typically consisting of lists of usernames and/or email addresses and the corresponding passwords (often from a data breach), and then uses the credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on other systems through large-scale automated login requests directed against a web application.

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain® framework is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense® model for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity.
The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.
The chain:
- Reconnaissance
  - Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.
- Weaponization
  - Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
- Delivery
  - Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.
- Exploitation
  - Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim's system
- Installation
  - Installing malware on the asset
- Command and control (C2)
  - Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
- Action on objectives
  - Intruders accomplish their goals

## Cyber Threat Intelligence
Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is knowledge, skills and experience-based information concerning the occurrence and assessment of both cyber and physical threats and threat actors that is intended to help mitigate potential attacks and harmful events occurring in cyberspace.

### Cyber threat intelligence - tactical
Technical intelligence (including Indicators of Compromise such as IP addresses, file names, or hashes) which can be used to assist in the identification of threat actors.

### Cyber threat intelligence - operational
Operational: details of the motivation or capabilities of threat actors, including their tools, techniques and procedures.

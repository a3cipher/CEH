## Security Information and Event Management
Security information and event management (SIEM) is a field within the field of computer security, where software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM).
They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.
Vendors sell SIEM as software, as appliances, or as managed services; these products are also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance purposes.

## Serverless
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers.
"Serverless" is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.

## Separation of Duties
Separation of duties (SoD), also known as segregation of duties is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task.
It is an administrative control used by organisations to prevent fraud, sabotage, theft, misuse of information, and other security compromises.

## Server Message Block
Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol[1] originally developed in 1983 by Barry A. Feigenbaum at IBM[2] and intended to provide shared access to files and printers across nodes on a network of systems running IBM's OS/2. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.

## Session Hijacking
In computer science, session hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking, is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.
In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server.

## Session Identifier
In computer science, a session identifier, session ID or session token is a piece of data that is used in network communications (often over HTTP) to identify a session, a series of related message exchanges.
Session identifiers become necessary in cases where the communications infrastructure uses a stateless protocol such as HTTP.

## Session Poisoning
Session poisoning (also referred to as "session data pollution" and "session modification") is a method to exploit insufficient input validation within a server application.
Typically a server application that is vulnerable to this type of exploit will copy user input into session variables.

## Simple Object Access Protocol
SOAP (formerly a backronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.
It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

## Social Engineering
In the context of information security, social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
This differs from social engineering within the social sciences, which does not concern the divulging of confidential information.

## Social Security Number
In the United States, a Social Security number (SSN) is a nine-digit number issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary (working) residents under section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2).

## Static Application Security Testing
Static application security testing (SAST) is used to secure software by reviewing the source code of the software to identify sources of vulnerabilities.
Although the process of statically analyzing the source code has existed as long as computers have existed, the technique spread to security in the late 90s and the first public discussion of SQL injection in 1998 when Web applications integrated new technologies like JavaScript and Flash.

## Structured Query Language
Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL,(/ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel", /ˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ (listen) S-Q-L; )[4][5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

## Structured Query Language Injection
In computing, SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

### Error based SQLi
The attacker performs actions that cause the database to produce error messages.
The attacker can potentially use the data provided by these error messages to gather information about the structure of the database.

### Union based SQLi
This technique takes advantage of the UNION SQL operator, which fuses multiple select statements generated by the database to get a single HTTP response.
This response may contain data that can be leveraged by the attacker.

### Boolean based SQLi
That attacker sends a SQL query to the database prompting the application to return a result.
The result will vary depending on whether the query is true or false.
Based on the result, the information within the HTTP response will modify or stay unchanged.
The attacker can then work out if the message generated a true or false result.

### Time based SQLi
Attacker sends a SQL query to the database, which makes the database wait (for a period in seconds) before it can react.
The attacker can see from the time the database takes to respond, whether a query is true or false.
Based on the result, an HTTP response will be generated instantly or after a waiting period.

## SYN Flood Attack
A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection.
The server has to spend resources waiting for half-opened connections, which can consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

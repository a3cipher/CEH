## Security Information and Event Management
Security information and event management (SIEM) is a field within the field of computer security, where software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM).
They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.
Vendors sell SIEM as software, as appliances, or as managed services; these products are also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance purposes.

## Separation of Duties
Separation of duties (SoD), also known as segregation of duties is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task.
It is an administrative control used by organisations to prevent fraud, sabotage, theft, misuse of information, and other security compromises.

## Server Message Block
Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol[1] originally developed in 1983 by Barry A. Feigenbaum at IBM[2] and intended to provide shared access to files and printers across nodes on a network of systems running IBM's OS/2. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.

## Session Hijacking
In computer science, session hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking, is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.
In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server.

## Session Identifier
In computer science, a session identifier, session ID or session token is a piece of data that is used in network communications (often over HTTP) to identify a session, a series of related message exchanges.
Session identifiers become necessary in cases where the communications infrastructure uses a stateless protocol such as HTTP.

## Session Poisoning
Session poisoning (also referred to as "session data pollution" and "session modification") is a method to exploit insufficient input validation within a server application.
Typically a server application that is vulnerable to this type of exploit will copy user input into session variables.

## Sheep Dip
In data security, a sheep-dip is the process of using a dedicated computer to test files on removable media for viruses before they are allowed to be used with other computers.

## Shoulder Surfing
In computer security, shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder.
Unauthorized users watch the keystrokes inputted on a device or listen to sensitive information being spoken, which is also known as eavesdropping.

## Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages.

## Simple Network Management Protocol
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behaviour.
Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.

## Social Engineering
In the context of information security, social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
This differs from social engineering within the social sciences, which does not concern the divulging of confidential information.

## Social Security Number
In the United States, a Social Security number (SSN) is a nine-digit number issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary (working) residents under section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2).

## Spanning Tree Protocol
The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks.
The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them.

## Split DNS
In computer networking, split-horizon DNS (also known as split-view DNS, split-brain DNS, or split DNS) is the facility of a Domain Name System (DNS) implementation to provide different sets of DNS information, usually selected by the source address of the DNS request.

## Spyware
Spyware (a portmanteau for spying software) is software with malicious behaviour that aims to gather information about a person or organization and send it to another entity in a way that harms the user—for example, by violating their privacy or endangering their device's security.

## Steganography
Steganography (/ˌstɛɡəˈnɒɡrəfi/ (listen) STEG-ə-NOG-rə-fee) is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the information is not evident to human inspection.

## Structured Query Language Injection
In computing, SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

## Switch
A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, and, by the IEEE, MAC bridge) is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device.

## SYN Flood Attack
A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection.
The server has to spend resources waiting for half-opened connections, which can consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

Reverse engineering
> Reverse engineering (also known as backwards engineering or back engineering) is a process or method through which one attempts to understand through deductive reasoning how a previously made device, process, system, or piece of software accomplishes a task with very little (if any) insight into exactly how it does so.

Replay attack

[Definition](../definitions/definitions_R.md#replay-attack)

Web shell
> A web shell is a shell-like interface that enables a web server to be remotely accessed, often for the purposes of cyberattacks.
> A web shell is unique in that a web browser is used to interact with it.

CMS (Content management system)
> A content management system (CMS) is computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content (content management).
> A CMS is typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM).

File inclusion vulnerability
> A file inclusion vulnerability is a type of web vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time.
> This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time.

Remote file inclusion
> Remote file inclusion (RFI) occurs when the web application downloads and executes a remote file.
> These remote files are usually obtained in the form of an HTTP or FTP URI as a user-supplied parameter to the web application.

MFA (Multi factor authentication)
> Multi-factor authentication (MFA; encompassing two-factor authentication, or 2FA, along with similar terms) is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user has), and inherence (something only the user is).
